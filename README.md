BlackjackV2
===========

Redo of Blackjack program in one week, GO!


I will remake the Blackjack game I coded about a year ago using the design patterns I have picked up in an intro 
to software engineering class. Model View Controller will be the chief design pattern.

=======================

Tuesday May 13
-Prototyped a design of UI

Thursday May 15
-UML'd and modeled version 1 
-went through an activity diagram of version 1's dealFirst procedure

Friday May 16
-Finalized prototype design of UI
-insurance shall have its own area on the screen, instead of a dialog box
-So far, the View shall have the actionlisteners for all the components, but each will call a function that the controller provides. That function would call logic functions in model.
